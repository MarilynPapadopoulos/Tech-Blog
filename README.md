# Tech-Blog
## Description 
This app is intended to be a blog where the user can add posts and comment on other's posts. It requires a log in and that the user be logged in order to perfom any of the actions.  This app was very challenging.  I found it especially difficult to organize all the different components that make up this app.  It will have to continue to be a work in progress as to date it does not function as intended.  

## Installation
The app has a seed file that can be implemented by: % npm run seed.  The app can be run by starting the server: % npm start.  It can then be view in your browser.  It is also deployed on Heroku. https://limitless-sands-34066.herokuapp.com

## Contributing
I relied heavily on a class lesson where I created Just-Tech-News app.  Much of the code from that project is similiar to what I needed to create this app.
